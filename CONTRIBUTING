So, here you are! Interested in contributing to this project? Very Nice!

Here is what you have to do:

 * Fork the repo.
 * Make whatever modifications you want, but just don't forget to do that on a separated branch. Do not commit on your repo's master branch.
 * Send me some pull requests and I'll be glad to read your code! Remember: Write tests, write code, refactor!
 * Easy, right?
 * So, Go hacking!
