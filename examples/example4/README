How to run this example
***********************

Here is a simple example demonstrating plugnplay (r0.4) in action. This example implements the simple program of the main README file. It's a copy-file program.

Here is what is needed to run it.
 
 * First install plugnplay. 
	easy_install plugnplay==0.4
	OR
	pip install plugnplay==0.4
 * cd to the examples/example4/filecopy folder: cd examples/example3/filecopy
 * Then, run the main.py file: 
    python main.py <file-to-copy>


Now take a look at the code to see how easy is to add another plugin!  You may implement another HashChecker plugin, i.e. sha-512. Save your new plugin inside the plugins folder and re-run the program to see your brand new plugin in action!
